>> HOW TO PLAY THIS GAME ON ANDROID OR IOS

This game loads external script files and images. Just opening the index.html file in a browser will not work on Android or IOS.

To play this game on your phone, you need two pieces of software: an HTTP server and a file extractor that can open the RAR file.

For Android, I recommend Simple HTTP Server for the server, and AZIP Master for file extraction. They both have free versions.

The steps are:

	1. Download and install an HTTP Server and an extraction tool.

	2. Download the Play Things RAR file.

	3. Use the extraction tool to extract all files in the RAR file to somewhere on your phone (remember where you put it!). I usually put mine in a subfolder of my Documents folder.

	4. Open the HTTP server program. It will have a space to set the 'root folder' for the server. Set it to the location where the index.html file for play things is stored.

	5. Start the HTTP server.

	6. The HTTP Server program will have it's address visible somewhere. This is often https://127.0.0.1 but there are alternatives. Open that location in your web browser.

	7. Play the game!
